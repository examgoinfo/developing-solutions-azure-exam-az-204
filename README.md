## getting starting to undestand azure 
Azure may be fairly scary because of the large quantity of services and possibilities. Therefore, in order to understand how Azure might be utilized within your field of work, it would make sense to select a certain study route. I would advise anyone interested in beginning an Azure project to go to the Microsoft Learn portal. The site is an excellent starting point for learning about Azure services.


The Exam main topics covered are:

* Develop Azure compute solutions (25–30%)
* Develop for Azure storage (15–20%)
* Implement Azure security (20–25%)
* Monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize Azure solutions (15–20%)
* Connect to and consume Azure services and third-party services (15–20%)
